# Image-Classifier
In this project, we'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells us the name of the flower our camera is looking at. In practice we will train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, we can see a few examples below.
